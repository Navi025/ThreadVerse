This directory should contain the 3D model files required for the ThreadVerse project:

- tshirt.glb
- hoodie.glb
- cap.glb
- sleevie.glb

Please add these GLTF/GLB model files here. If you need sample models, you can download or create them using 3D modeling tools.

Without these files, the 3D t-shirt component will not function correctly.
